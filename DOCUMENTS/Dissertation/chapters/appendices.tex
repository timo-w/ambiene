\chapter{Appendices}

Use separate appendix chapters for groups of ancillary material that support your dissertation. 
Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (you must include these if you needed to get them)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects. Don't include
  voluminous data logs; instead submit these electronically alongside your source code.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.
\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), 
    or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.
\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software. 
Your equivalent of \texttt{readme.md} should be included.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.
