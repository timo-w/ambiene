%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
In this project, I have developed an online collaborative music application, where users can create relaxing, real-time, procedurally-generated music together in an engaging and intuitive online environment. This involved developing systems for creating continuously generative music, and synchronising the experience across all connected users.

After conducting a user evaluation on the live, deployed site, users reported feeling relaxed, engaged, and socially connected with one another while they enjoyed a collaborative music-making experience.

%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Mathieu Chollet for his help and guidance during this project.

I'd also like to extend my gratitude towards Lewis Fraser and Danny Christie for providing me company during the last-minute all-nighters, my flatmate Aidan Ferguson for dealing with the unwashed dishes, and all my friends at GU Rocketry for giving me the support and encouragement to get through this final year in one piece.

%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not
% included in the page count. 
%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. 

% PAGE LIMITS
% You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a 
% 20 credit report. 
% This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but *excluding the appendices and bibliography*.
%
% FORMATTING
% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.
% Do not alter the bibliography style. 
%
%==================================================================================================================================
%
% IMPORTANT
% The chapter headings and structure here are **suggestions**. You don't have to follow this model if
% it doesn't fit your project. Every project should have an introduction and conclusion,
% however.  If in doubt, your supervisor can give you specific guidance; their view takes precedence over
% the structure suggested here.
